0001  #Done		Change how time is implemented. The signal should be
                registered directly at the Reactor 

0002  #Done     Add several typical Time signals like 'seconds',
                'minutes', 'hours' and so on

0003  #Done     Check once more the methods that create source signals
                defined in class Reactor. Can they be unified further?

0004  #Done		Create a SF from signal to event stream that skips the
                signal's initial value. Use this to implement signals
                'seconds' and so on as well as the final counter in the
                user bob example.

0005  #High		Change type aliases for EF. EF[A,B] should be
                SF[Event[A],Event[B].

0006  #High		Add symbolic aliases >=> and <=< for andThen and compose.

0007  #High		Add type aliases SEF and ESF.

0008  #High		Implement Contravariant for SF and EF. Test that in
                case of EF its Contravariant implementation takes
                precedence

0009  #High		Implement Applicative for EF and check that it takes precedence
                over Applicative implementation for SF

0010  #High		Implement Arrow for EF and check that it takes precedence
                over Arrow implementation for SF
