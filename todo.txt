0001  #Done		Change how time is implemented. The signal should be
                registered directly at the Reactor 

0002  #Done     Add several typical Time signals like 'seconds',
                'minutes', 'hours' and so on

0003  #Done     Check once more the methods that create source signals
                defined in class Reactor. Can they be unified further?

0004  #Done		Create a SF from signal to event stream that skips the
                signal's initial value. Use this to implement signals
                'seconds' and so on as well as the final counter in the
                user bob example.

0005  #Done		Change type aliases for EF. EF[A,B] should be
                SF[Event[A],Event[B]. No longer needed with new design

0006  #Done		Add symbolic aliases >=> and <=< for andThen and compose.

0007  #Done		Add type aliases SEF and ESF. No longer needed.

0008  #High		Implement Contravariant for SF and EF. Test that in
                case of EF its Contravariant implementation takes
                precedence

0009  #Done		Implement Applicative for EF and check that it takes precedence
                over Applicative implementation for SF. No longer needed

0010  #Done		Implement Arrow for EF and check that it takes precedence
                over Arrow implementation for SF. No longer needed

0011  #High		Implement Monoid for data sink
