0001  #Done		Change how time is implemented. The signal should be
                registered directly at the Reactor 

0002  #Done     Add several typical Time signals like 'seconds',
                'minutes', 'hours' and so on

0003  #Done     Check once more the methods that create source signals
                defined in class Reactor. Can they be unified further?

0004  #High		Create a SF from signal to event stream that skips the
                signal's initial value. Use this to implement signals
                'seconds' and so on as well as the final counter in the
                user bob example.
