/** Provides utility signal functions for dealing with Undo/Redo
  * functionality.
  *
  * Typically, undo/redo events are looped back to the input of
  * the undo/redo stream to keep track of the actual state of the
  * editable data. This should not lead to the registering of a
  * new Undo/Redo handler, however. We therefor distinguish at 
  * the input level between changes coming from user input and
  * changes coming from undo/redo. This is done using `\/` where
  * by convention user input is wrapped in a right and undo/redo
  * in a left.

    * This signal function does not make assumptions about where
    * events are coming from or what is going to happen with the
    * undoable data pair with one exception:
    * By convention, input wrapped in a Right is assumed to come
    * from user input while input wrapped in a Left comes from Undo/Redo
    * and leads therefor not to a new event of pairs being fired.
    *
    * In client code the output of this function is typically looped back
    * to its input at some point.
